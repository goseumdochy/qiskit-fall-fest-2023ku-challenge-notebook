# qiskit-fall-fest-2023ku-challenge-notebook

These are the challenge notebooks for the challenge, which was the last event of the [Qiskit Fall Fest at KU 2023](https://github.com/goseumdochy/qiskit-fall-fest-2023ku). It consists of 10 challenge notebooks, and there are solutions and problems for each challenge. The solution in the solution file is only an example and other correct answers may exist.

In Qiskit Fall Fest at KU 2023, the participants were asked to set up their virtual environments according to the virtual environment setting instructions on the [grader github page](https://github.com/goseumdochy/qiskit-fall-fest-ku-grader). The grader github page has a `setup.py` file. The `setup.py` file was created to install the packages needed to run Qiskit and the packages for automatic grader.
